# Rent-Advising
This project aims to provide assistance in the choice of accommodation via an interactive web page. Displays a city map where the main points (metro stations) are evaluated on two criteria : - distance from the workplace - housing prices per square metre    The map makes the search area easy to navigate, with intuitive colour coding.
